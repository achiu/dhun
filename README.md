Dhun is a minimalist commandline music player for OS X.

It uses Spotlight to search for audio files on your computer and play them.

## Quickstart

### Installing Dhun

Run the following commands to install Dhun. This will download the latest gem
from [http://gemcutter.org](http://gemcutter.org), compile the extensions and
put the binaries in the right place.

    $ gem sources -a http://gemcutter.org
    $ gem install dhun

### Starting Dhun

    $ dhun start
    Starting Dhun

Currently it runs in the foreground and displays a lot of random output. There
are plans to daemonize the service once the codebase has stabilized a bit, and
I have implemented some logging capabilities.

### Playing Files

Dhun uses Spotlight to query for music files. Just specify a keyword, and Dhun
will look for files matching that keyword and start playing them

    $ dhun play
    9 files queued for playing
    /Users/deepak/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Music/Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros/Here Comes/01 40 Day Dream.mp3
    /Users/deepak/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Music/Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros/Here Comes/02 Janglin.mp3

### Stopping Dhun

## Coming Soon

These features are planned in the next few releases

* Option to run Dhun server as a daemon
* Logging
* Playing previous song, using something like `dhun prev`
* Skipping ahead by more than one file, like `dhun next 2` or `dhun prev 2`
* Advanced querying support with filters, like `dhun play "artist:Rahman"`

And someday..

* iTunes integration
* Ability to pause and play in the middle of music files.
* Displaying IDv3 information instead of just file names
