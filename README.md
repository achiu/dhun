Dhun is a minimalist commandline music player for OS X.

It uses Spotlight to search for audio files on your computer and play them.

## Quickstart

### Installing Dhun

Run the following commands to install Dhun. This will download the latest gem
from [http://gemcutter.org](http://gemcutter.org), compile the extensions and
put the binaries in the right place. You will need to have XCode installed for
the `gem` command to compile the native extensions.

    $ gem sources -a http://gemcutter.org
    $ gem install dhun

### Starting Dhun

    $ dhun start
    Starting Dhun

Pass the `-d` option to run the server as a daemon in the background. See
`dhun -h` for more options.

### Playing Files

Dhun uses Spotlight to query for music files. Just specify a keyword, and Dhun
will look for files matching that keyword and start playing them.

You can also query the Spotlight database before playing the files.

    $ dhun query here

will remove anything that may be already there on your queue. To add files,
use `enqueue`.

## Coming Soon

These features are planned in the next few releases

* Playing previous song, using something like `dhun prev`
* Skipping ahead by more than one file, like `dhun next 2` or `dhun prev 2`
* Advanced querying support with filters, like `dhun play "artist:Rahman"`

And someday..

* iTunes integration
* Displaying IDv3 information instead of just file names
